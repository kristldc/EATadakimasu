EATadakimasu Project Notes.
by Kimberly Campomanes, Kristelle Dela Cruz, and Trish Lalata

- the program is developed to run in Linux

- makefile is already included for easier compiling.

- the program was made with the guidance of @abuharth's snake game code on GitHub. link can be found here -> https://github.com/abuharth/snake-term. our program is not an exact replica of the reference code as it was only used to guide us in developing the essential mechanics of the game.

- the game has additional features such as more foods types that the snake could eat
